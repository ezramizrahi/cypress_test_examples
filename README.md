## About

An SPA with a few E2E testing examples using Cypress and Cucumber. The application let's you search for a number of predefined films and directors (see the `films.js` file). The Cypress tests (see the `cypress/integration` directory) are straightforward and should hopefully demonstrate a simple E2E testing flow.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
* [Cypress.IO](https://www.cypress.io/)
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)

4. Run it
